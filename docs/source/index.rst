The SaGe query engine
=======================================

`SaGe <http://sage.univ-nantes.fr/>`_ is a SPARQL query engine for public Linked Data providers
that implements Web preemption. The SPARQL engine includes a smart
SaGe client and a SaGe SPARQL query server hosting RDF datasets.
SPARQL queries are suspended by the web server after a fixed
quantum of time and resumed upon client request.
Using Web preemption, SaGe ensures stable response times
for query execution and completeness of results under high load.

The complete approach and experimental results are available
in a Research paper accepted at The Web Conference 2019, `available here <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02017155/document>`_.
